Administrative Note
===================

If the IRC logging stops working for a while, coordinate on #bcfg2 and
then bug **feb** on #irclogger (freenode), and stick around on that
channel until you get an answer (**feb** is great, but busy and in a
non-US time zone). Actually as long as **ilogger2** is logged in you
should be okay (**feb** looks at the logs).

If you have private logs for the period of time **ilogger2** was off the
channel, you can convert them to the will incorporate them into the online
logs. Be sure to strip out any private messages in your logs first :-)
